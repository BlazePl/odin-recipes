    <h2> Ready to go? Only <b>TWO</b> steps!</h2>
    <ol>
        <li> <b>Step</b>  </li>
        <p>Add oats, banana slices and sea salt to a pot. Add water and stir to combine. 
            Add cinnamon and vanilla, if using. Heat over medium-high heat for 8-10 minutes or until all the liquid has been absorbed. 
            Be sure to stir the oats several times while cooking to make sure the banana slices melt into the oats. 
            Youâ€™ll know the oatmeal is done when all the liquid is absorbed and the oats are thick and fluffy.</p>
       
        <li> <b>Step</b>  </li>
        <p>Remove oats from the heat and stir in protein powder. If the consistency of the oats gets too thick, add in a little more water or milk. Transfer oats to a bowl and top with your favorite oatmeal toppings. I used chocolate chips, peanut butter and bananas. </p>
